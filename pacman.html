        <h1>Welcome to Pacman!</h1>
        <p>This is a <strong>very</strong> bare-bones version of the game (the ghosts aren't even here yet!). However, more features will be added as we go along!</p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Use your arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move around the board. Right now, Pacman collects coins (no points... yet!) and bumps into walls. Slowly, he will be able to do more, I promise!</p>
        <p>Hit reset or refresh your browser window to play again.</p>
